python libraries aren't as good as real api
want to learn how to use api not the library

apis can be assets or liabilities to a company
new customers or more support calls

api design
    small as possible but no smaller
        minimal set of required methods no extra compleexity

    implementation shouldn't impact api
        internal implementation don't affect the api exposed to users. 
        users interact only through the provided endpoints

    minimize accesibility of everything
        implementation details are kept private

    names matter
        method names and parameter names are chosen to be descriptive and meaningful
        make it clear how to use api

    documentaion matters
        documentation should be provided for each method to explain their purpose and usage


graphQL
introduced by facebook
to imporove some shortcomings of REST APIs
    rest apis are rigid
    lots of use cases dont need all the retrieved data
    lots of use cases need several api calls to gather specific goal data

at server 
    sdl to define schema
    resolver interprets queries
