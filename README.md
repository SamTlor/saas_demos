## Introduction

In the "saas-demo" repository, you will find a collection of code samples, examples, and demonstrations that are directly related to the topics covered in the CMSC 455 class. The purpose of this repository is to provide students with hands-on experience and practical implementations of concepts discussed during the course.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project and its dependencies on your local machine.

### Setting Up Python 3

Before you begin, make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system. If you don't have it installed, you can download and install it from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installing Dependencies

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/saas-demo.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username.

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd saas-demo
   ```

3. Create a virtual environment (recommended) to isolate the project's dependencies:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

   On macOS and Linux:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```bash
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

5. Install the project's dependencies using `pip` and the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

This will install all the necessary packages and libraries required for the project.

## Usage

Each demo or example will be organized into separate folders within the repository. You can navigate into each folder and follow the specific instructions provided in the README files for each demo. Feel free to explore, modify, and experiment with the code to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts being taught in the CMSC 455 class.
